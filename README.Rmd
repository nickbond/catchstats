#catchstats

catchstats includes a number of functions written by Chris Walsh for working with nested catchment or river-network data tables, to identify all upstream areas, all downstream areas, segments or sub-catchments between catchment pairs etc. All of these functions require a dataframe that includes a unique catchment identifier field (column) and a field (column) identifying the next downstream catchment id. Together these are referred to as a 'hierarchy table'.


#Installation
To install run the following code: 

```
  # install devtools pacakge
  install.packages(c("devtools"))

  # install catchstats package
	devtools::install_github("nickbond/catchstats")

	# Remove the package zip after installation
	unlink("catchstats.zip")
	
	#load library
	library(catchstats)
```

#Example 

To be completed
<!--  The code below produces the following plot for Cooper Creek, a highly ephemeral river in western Queensland, Australia. The function uses geom_raster() from the ggplot2 package. Addtional options are available (see ?ctf_heatmap for details). -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!--  library(hydrostats) -->
<!--  library(hydroplots) -->
<!--  data(Cooper) -->
<!--  ctf_heatmap(Cooper) -->
<!-- ```  -->
