\description{
Code to download monthly AWAP grids to a specified directory
}
\note{
The files will be downloaded to the directories awap_zip files and awap_raw_data
within the current working directory. The function first checks to see which zip
files have previously been downloaded, and for this reason, if deleting files to save
disk space it is best to delete the unzipped files in the directory 'awap_raw_data'.
Re-running the function will then unzip the files again after checking for any new
data files on the server.
